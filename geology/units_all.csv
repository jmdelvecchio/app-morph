The basal Emigsville is a laterally persistent basinal facies with two components. The lower third is argillaceous dolomite and dolomitic limestone, overlain by shale. The York includes well-bedded lime mudstones, oolitic and bioclastic lime grainstones, and minor occurrences of periplatform breccia. [York was called Thomasville Member by Gohn (1976).] The Greenmount Member is a distinctive, impure carbonate (dark, pyritic, laminated to nodular limestone) with abundant fine-grained siliciclastic sediment which occurs as black shaly interbeds and dispersed silt-sized quartz and feldspar grains. Age of the Kinzers is Early Cambrian. Kinzers Formation in the West York block of the Conestoga Valley, York Co., PA, is here subdivided into the basal Emigsville Member (Gohn, 1976), the York Member (new name), and the Greenmount Member (new name).

York previously informally designated Thomasville member by Gohn (1976). Thickness approximately 1000 to 1200 ft. Consists very pure to moderately pure carbonates. Greenmount Member described as sandstone and siltstone with very little carbonate where weathered. May be equivalent to Gohn's (1976) Longs Park member in Lancaster Co. Thickness varies from 50 ft to 180 ft. Authors state, ""The long history of use of the name Kinzers dictates the need for its continued use. The rocks included within the Kinzers Formation, however, vary dramatically from the type locality in Lancaster Co. to the York Valley portion of the Conestoga Valley.

Units here mapped as Alligator Back Formation were previously mapped as the Evington Group (Espenshade, 1954; Brown, 1958; Redden, 1963; Gates, 1986; Patterson, 1987) and considered to be younger than the Lynchburg Group. Regional mapping by Henika (1991) and Scheible (1975) indicates that rocks assigned to Alligator Back Formation by Rankin and others (1973) are continuous with the upper part of the Lynchburg Group in the type section along the James River at Lynchburg (Jonas, 1927) and that the Alligator Back consistently dips southeast beneath the overlying Candler Formation from the Virginia-North Carolina border to the James River at Lynchburg. Sedimentary and structural facing criteria indicate that rock units immediately southeast of the Candler Formation in an outcrop belt from Stapleton on the James River, southwest to Leesville Dam on the Roanoke River, are older than the Candler (Henika, 1992). Although previously mapped as upper Evington Group (Espenshade, 1954; Brown, 1958; Redden, 1963; Patterson, 1987), these rocks are herein correlated with the Alligator Back Formation (upper Lynchburg Group), having been uplifted against the Candler Formation to the northwest along the Bowens Creek fault (Henika, 1992). Rocks in the same outcrop belt along strike to the southwest of the Leesville Reservoir were previously correlated with the Alligator Back Formation by Conley (1985). The sequence of lithologic units within the Alligator Back Formation southeast of the Bowens Creek fault is the same as that proposed by Brown (1951; 1958), and Espenshade (1954) for the formations in the Evington Group, that are structurally above the Candler Formation. The sequence is based on the detailed structural and stratigraphic relationships first established by Brown (1958) in the Lynchburg 15-minute quadrangle.

It and the underlying Stonehenge Limestone, are equivalent to the Mas cot and Kingsport Dolomites of the upper part of the Knox Group. It is unconformably overlain by Middle Ordovician limestones and conformably overlies the Stonehenge Limestone. Erosion, related to the unconformity at the top of the Beekmantown Group and Knox Group, has produced erosional breccias, local topographic relief, and paleokarst topography as well as significant regional thinning of the rock units. The Beekmantown Group thins from about 3000 feet in Page County to less than 700 feet in Washington County, largely because of post-Beekmantown erosion . Stonehenge Limestone (Sando, 1956).

The formation ranges be tween 1500 and 2900 feet in thickness in the southeasternmost exposures but is incomplete elsewhere due to faulting. The Elbrook of northern Virginia is transitional with the Nolichucky and Honaker Formations (locally the limestone facies of the Nolichucky has been differentiated from the Elbrook by Bartlett and Biggs (1980). It is also approximately equivalent to the rock sequence comprised of the Nolichucky and Maryville Formations, the Rogersville Shale, and the Rutledge Formation. Farther southwest the Conasauga Shale is the Elbrook equivalent. The Elbrook appears to be conformable and gradational with the underlying Waynesboro or Rome Formations. From Washington County to Augusta County much of the Elbrook Formation adjacent to the Pulaski and Staunton faults is a breccia of the ""Max Meadows tecontic breccia type"" (Cooper and Haff, 1940). These breccias are composed of crushed rock clasts that range from sand size to blocks many feet long, derived almost entirely from the lower part of the Elbrook Formation.

Mineralogy: calcite + quartz + muscovite +/- graphite +/- chlorite +/- albite +/- pyrite + tourmaline. The Everona occurs dominantly as lenticular bodies immediately north west of or within the Mountain Run fault zone (Evans, 1984; Conley, 1989; Rossman, 1991). In most outcrops primary laminations are complexly folded due to strain accommodation associated with the Mountain Run fault. Unit thickness and degree of lateral continuity are structurally controlled in many places. Mack (1965) reports thicknesses ranging from about 20 to 1100 feet. Jonas (1927) reports retrieving trilobite fragments from sandy beds adjacent to the Everona, but these were so poorly preserved that E.O. Ulrich could not identify them, even with respect to genus. Recent attempts to extract conodonts from the Everona have so far proven fruitless. The Everona is interpreted to be in stratigraphic continuity with phyllites and metasiltstones that are conformable above the Catoctin Formation (Evans, 1984; Rossman, 1991), and is likely Early Paleozoic in age.

Contact metamorphic mineral assemblages: (1) andalusite + sillimanite + kyanite + corundum; (2) corundum + spinel + magnetite + kyanite. Geophysical signature: The Fork Mountain has a characteristic ""curly maple"" pattern on magnetic contour maps. This pattern is the result of isolated concentrations of highly magnetic minerals that produce rounded, high-intensity, positive and negative anomalies. The aluminosilicate-mica schist is the upper part of the Fork Mountain Formation and forms a series of northeastward- trending ridges along the northwest side of the Smith River allochthon. The garnetiferous biotite gneiss is at a lower structural level of the Fork Mountain Formation near Martinsville where lower strata have been intruded by the Martinsville igneous complex, and the remaining metasedimentary rocks contain extensive thermal meta mor phic zones locallized along the intrusive contacts (Conley and Henika, 1973). Biotite gneiss in the Fork Mountain Formation has been interpreted to be a highly metamorphosed diamictite (Rankin, 1975; Conley, 1985; and Pavlides, 1989). At the northeastern limit of the Fork Mountain outcrop belt, in Appomattox and Buckingham counties, the dominant lithologies are polydeformed yellowish-gray chloritoid-chlorite- muscovite quartzose phyllite and quartz-rich mica schist. Tightly-folded, transposed pinstriped segregation layering at a high angle to the penetrative schistosity defined by phyllosilicate minerals is characteristic; polycrystalline quartz-rich boudins are abundant.

From expanded explanation (ref. VA002): Metabasalt breccia (low-titanium) (Espenshade, 1986). Blocky or angular fragments of grayish-green, fine grained rock in a fine-grained, ge erally schistose matrix. Breccia fragments range from 1 to 20 cm long, and form rough, knobby surfaces on weathered outcrops. Where present, this breccia occurs at or near the base of Catoctin metabasalt (CZc) on the southeast limb of the Blue Ridge anticlinorium; the unit is as much as 3000 feet thick. Furcron (1939) mapped both high- and low-titanium breccias as Warrenton agglomerate; R.L. Smith (personal communication in Espenshade, 1986) interpreted the breccias as subareal agglutinates. Kline and others (1990) presented evidence that the breccias are hyaloclastite pillow breccias, erupted in a subaqueous environment. Reed (1955) recognized a mappable stratigraphy within the Catoctin, and made the interpretation that the greenstones were metamorphosed tholeiitic flood basalts that originated in a ""nonorogenic"" setting. Rankin (1975) considered the Catoctin to have originated during continental volcanism associated with the opening of a proto-Atlantic Iapetus ocean in Latest Precambrian time, and included the Catoctin in the Crossnore volcanic-plutonic group. Badger and Sinha (1988) studied chemical stratigraphy within individual fl ows and dated Catoctin metabasalts at 570 +/- 36 Ma using Rb-Sr systematics on samples showing little evidence of elemental mobility during metamorphism. This date is consistent with radiometric age data from Catoctin metarhyolite, discussed above, and with the occurrence of Early Cambrian-age Rusophycus stratigraphically above the Catoctin near the base of the Chilhowee Group (Simpson and Sundberg, 1987). These constraints suggest that some portion of the Catoctin may be as young as Cambrian in age. Regional mapping suggests that metabasalts and amphibole gneisses within the Ashe (Zaa), Alligator Back (CZas), and Bassett Formations (CZba) are volcanogenic rocks that are correlative with the Catoctin in a lithostratigraphic sense and in terms of tectonic setting, but not necessarily in a strict time sense. Catoctin volcanism likely spanned a considerable time period; correlative units to the southwest were probably time-transgressive to a degree. ",VA003,meta-basalt,,,VA001 VA002 VA003,

Reed and Morgan (1971) demonstrated on the basis of geochemistry that metadiabase dikes cutting Grenville basement in northern Virginia are feeders to the Catoctin. Metagabbroic dikes in the central Virginia Blue Ridge could represent a deeper level of Catoctin feeder system, although that hypothesis has not been substantiated by field or geochemical study.

Geophysical signature: strike-elongate positive magnetic anomaly. Metamorphosed mafic and ultramafic complexes are generally sheet-like bodies, concordant near the base of the Alligator Back and Charlottesville Formations. In Nelson County, these rocks are cut by metagabbroic dikes (CZmd) that are likely related to the Catoctin. Hess (1933) reports a stratified association of ultramafic, mafic, and minor silicic lithologies at Schuyler which he attributes to in situ differentiation of a sheet-like concordant intrusion. Glover and others (1989) report a non-tectonized intrusive contact between Charlottesville Formation metasiltstone and ultramafic schist at Schulyer. In contrast, Conley (1985) presents evidence that ultramafic-mafic complexes in Franklin County are tectonicly-emplaced slices of oceanic crust (ophiolites).

From expanded explanation (ref. VA002): Metagraywacke, quartzose schist, and melange. Metagraywackes are quartzose chlorite or biotite schists containing very fine to coarse granules of blue quartz; primary graded laminations have been transposed by shearing into elongate lozenges that give the rock a distinctive pin-striped appearance in weathered surfaces perpendicular to schistosity. A mylonitic fabric is superimposed in varying degrees, as are late-stage chevron-style folds. In Buckingham, Appomattox, and Campbell Counties, rocks in this unit are progressively more tectonized from east to west across the outcrop belt; in the western portion, the dominant lithology is a polydeformed, mylonitic mica schist with abundant quartz-rich boudins; transposed pinstriped lamination or segregation layering at a high angle to mylonitic schistosity is characteristic. Metagabbroic blocks ranging in size from 5 cm to 3 m across and larger have been identified at widely scattered locations throughout the outcrop belt. Mineralogy: quartz + albite + epidote + chlorite + muscovite + magnetite +/- chloritoid +/- calcite; biotite- and staurolite-bearing assemblages occur in Appomattox and Campbell Counties. Detrital minerals identifi ed in thin section include plagioclase, perthite, epidote, magnetite, tourmaline, and titanite. Lithic fragments include dacite tuff, gabbro, and monocrystalline quartz with zircon and biotite inclusions (Evans, 1984). The northern portion of the outcrop belt includes melange zone IV of the Mine Run complex of Pavlides (1989; 1990). In Albemarle and Fluvanna counties, CZpm includes the lower chlorite-muscovite unit of Smith and others (1964) and Hardware metagraywacke of Evans (1984). In Appomattox and Buckingham Counties, polydeformed quartzose mica schists in the western portion of the outcrop belt are lithologically indistinguishable from schists mapped as Fork Mountain Formation in structural blocks that occur to the west; these units are considered to be at least in part correlative.

The group consists of shale, sandstone, mudstone, conglomerate, siltstone, minor limestone, and coal locally. The shale, siltstone, and mud stone are gray to black and shades of red, and mottled red and gray. The sandstone is locally quartzose and conglomeratic, and ranges from shades of gray to brown, and only locally mottled within red shales; many sandstones pinch out southwestward in the Tazewell County area, but two persist farther west and southwest. The limestone is gray to brown, generally near the middle of the group, and is the most widespread marine unit.

The Princeton Sandstone wedges out in Tazewell County. The top of the Pennington Group is intertonguing to unconform ble with the overlying Lee Formation in the western part of the Southwest Virginia coalfield; basal contact is conformable. The Group thins westward; variation in thickness partly due to intertonguing and the unconformity. The Pennington Group ranges from 235 feet in thickness without the Pinacle Overlook Member of the Lee (as interpreted from Vanover and others, 1989) in the south west to 2355 feet (Trent and Spencer, 1990) in Tazewell County and 1335 feet in a partial section in Washington County (Bartlett and Webb, 1971), where it is mapped as the Pennington Formation.

Lithology highly variable, depending on the nature of the parent rock, and on intensive parameters and history of deformation. In most mapped belts of mylonite and cataclastic rock (my), tectonized rocks anastomose around lenses of less-deformed or undeformed rock. In the Blue Ridge, some of these lenses are large enough to show at 1:500,000 scale. In many places mylonitic and cataclastic rocks are gradational into less deformed or undeformed adjacent rocks, and location of contacts between tectonized rocks (my) and adjacent units is approximate or arbitrary. These boundaries are indicated on the map by color-color joins with superimposed shear pattern. Most mapped belts of mylonite represent fault zones with multiple movement histories. In the Blue Ridge, Paleozoic age contractional deformation fabrics are superimposed on Late Precambrian extensional fabrics (Simpson and Kalaghan, 1989; Bailey and Simpson, 1993). Many Piedmont mylonite zones contain dextral-transpressional kinematic indicators that formed during Late Paleozoic collision al tectonics (Bobyarchick and Glover, 1979; Gates and others, 1986).

Dominantly dark gray to grayish-black, lustrous, very-fine-grained, graphitic slate (northeastern sector); and, medium-grained, porphyroblastic garnetiferous biotite schist (southwestern sector). Discontinuous beds of quartzose muscovite schist, coarse grained to pebbly micaceous quartzite, and conglomeratic schist occur along the margins of the outcrop belt, stratigraphically at the base of the section. Interbeds of dacite metatuff occur in the western portion of the slate outcrop belt. Graded laminated metasiltstone and metasandstone are interbedded with slate in the central and eastern portions of the outcrop belt at the latitude of the James River (Evans and Marr, 1988); these rocks pass into porphyroblastic schists at higher metamorphic grades to the southwest. A distinctive garnet-amphibole-quartz interbed occurs within porphyroblastic schist south of the James River (volcanogenic marker?; Brown, 1969); north of the river, this passes down metamoprphic grade into what is described as an oolitic chlorite schist (Smith and others, 1964). Mineralogy: (slate) chlorite + mus co vite + plagioclase + quartz + magnetite +/- biotite +/- calcite +/- graphite +/- pyrite; (porphyroblastic schist) biotite + muscovite + garnet + quartz + plagioclase + magnetite +/- kyanite +/- calcite; tourmaline and zircon are common accessories. Geophysical signature: The Arvonia is marked by positive magnetic and radiometric anomalies. Originally referred to as the slate in the Arvonia belt by Rogers (1884), the unit was named Arvonia slate by Stose and Stose (1948), and raised to formation status by Brown (1969). An Upper Ordovician age for the Arvonia has been established from fossils collected by Watson and Powell (1911), Stose and Stose (1948), Tillman (1970), and Kolata and Pavlides (1986). The Arvonia has long been considered unconformable on top of adjacent units. Micaceous quartzite, pebbly mus covite schist, and conglomeratic schist are common at the base of the section where that boundary is not faulted (Stose and Stose, 1948; Smith and others, 1964; Brown, 1969; Evans and Marr, 1988). The base of the Arvonia is exposed in an old railroad cut near Carysbrook, Fluvanna County (Smith and others, 1964); there, a micaceous quartzite containing quartz pebbles rests on granite of the Carysbrook pluton. The Stoses (1948) considered the Arvonia a sequence deposited on a post-Taconic-orogeny regional unconformity, and folded and metamorphosed during subsequent orogenies; that interpretation is consistent with geologic constraints as we know them today. The Arvonia is correlated with the Quantico Formation. History of the Arvonia district slate industry is discussed by Brown (1969) and Evans and Marr (1988). ",VA003,slate,schist,,VA001 VA002 VA003,

Conglomeratic schist occurs along the western margin of the principal Buffards outcrop belt, and as discontinuous lenses too small to show at 1:500,000 scale, at or near the western margin (stratigraphic base) of the Arvonia slate outcrop belt (Oa) (Evans and Marr, 1988). Although Brown (1969) in defining the Buffards Formation considered these rocks to be a pyroclastic deposit stratigraphically above the Arvonia Formation, other workers have interpreted Buffards rocks to be at a lower stratigraphic position relative to the Arvonia. Conley and Marr (1980) considered the Buffards part of the Chopawamsic Formation, unconformably below the Arvonia. Stose and Stose (1948) and Evans and Marr (1988) considered the Buffards to be stratigraphically at or near the base of the Arvonia Formation. Buffards conglomeratic schists contain tuffaceous and ferruginous-quartzite clasts similar to rocks that occur in the Chopawamsic Formation; this is consistent with the Buffards being derived in part from, and deposited unconformably on, the Chopawamsic.

Mineralogy: plagioclase + quartz + microcline; common accessories include biotite, muscovite, epidote, zircon, apatite, garnet, magnetite, and pyrite (Bourland and Glover, 1979). Geophysical signature: diffuse magnetic lows and radiometric highs. The pluton was originally named Columbia Granite by Jonas (1928); this name was objected to by later workers because of the relatively small percentage of true granite present. The pluton includes the southeastern portion of the granodiorite unit of Smith and others (1964). Granitic rocks in the Carysbrook area of Fluvanna County are here considered part of a separate Carysbrook pluton, following the usage of Stose and Stose (1948). The Columbia includes, in part, the Hatcher complex of Brown (1969). Bourland and Glover (1979) refer to the pluton as the Columbia metagranite. Given the heterogeneous nature of the pluton, multiple intrusive phases are likely present.	 Tonalite in the eastern part of the pluton has yielded ages of 590 +/- 80 Ma, (Rb-Sr whole-rock; Fullagar, 1971). Mose and Nagel (1982) report a Rb-Sr whole-rock age for the Columbia of 454 +/- 9 Ma.

Metamorphosed anorthosite includes non-foliated extremely coarse-grained and foliated, recrystallized coarse-grained textural varieties. Primary mineralogy consists of antiperthitic plagioclase, clinopyroxene, apatite, and ilmenite. Amphibole, biotite, quartz, garnet, rutile, and titanite occur as later metamorphic minerals (Farrar, 1984). Xenoliths in the anorthosite could have been derived from the adjacent amphibolite and amphibole gneiss (Ya), porphyroblastic garnet-biotite gneiss (Ymd), and State Farm gneiss (Ysf).	 Geophysical signature: positive radiometric and negative magnetic anomalies. Close geochemical similarities between the Montpelier and the Grenville-age Roseland anorthosite of the central Blue Ridge (Yra) have led to the hypothesis, as yet untested, that the Montpelier is Grenville in age (Clement and Bice, 1982; Farrar, 1984).

Mesocratic, medium- to coarse-grained, biotite-rich quartzofeldspathic gneiss con tains prominent subhedral to euhedral monocrystalline feldspar augen. The ratio plagioclase: potassium feldspar may be as high as 10:1; color index ranges from 30 to 50. Apatite, epidote, muscovite, ilmenite, and titanite are ubiquitous accessories. Plagioclase contains abundant prismatic epidote and white mica; ilmenite is rimmed with masses of anhedral titanite; subhedral hornblende and subhedral to euhedral almandine-grossular garnet occur locally. In the vicinity of adjacent charnockite, anhedral actinolitic amphibole pseudomorphs after pyroxene or rims thoroughly uralitized relict pyroxene. Rock fabric is gradational from granofels to mylonite gneiss. Geophysical signature: negative magnetic signature relative to adjacent charnockite. In northern Virginia, this unit strongly resembles prophyroblastic granite gneiss (Ybp); however, the augen in Ybp are more commonly polycrystalline aggregates rather than single-crystal porphyroblasts. This unit is widespread in the central and southeastern Blue Ridge, encompassing a number of lithologically similar metaplutonic entities: the ""biotitic facies""of the Roses Mill and Turkey Mountain ferrodiorites of Herz and Force (1987), the Archer Mountain quartz monzonite of Bartholomew and others (1981), biotite granofels and augen gneiss of Evans (1984, 1991), biotite augen gneiss of Conley (1989), and augen-bearing gneiss of Lukert and Halladay (1980), and Lukert and Nuckols (1976). Historically, most workers have interpreted these rocks as Grenville-age plutons in which the present-day biotite-rich mineral assemblage is a primary igneous assemblage that crystallized from a melt (for example, Bartholomew and others, 1981). Herz and Force (1987) and Evans (1991) presented evidence that these biotite gneisses were derived from charnockite plutons by retrograde hydration reactions.	 Pettingill and others (1984) reported ages of 1009 +/- 26 Ma (Rb-Sr whole-rock) and 1004 +/- 36 Ma (Sm-Nd whole-rock) for ferrodiorite to quartzmonzonite in the Roseland district.

Porphyroblasts of potassium feldspar range from 1 to 10 cm while plagioclase and quartz are generally 2 cm or less in maximum dimension. Mafic minerals, including almandine, biotite, chlorite, hornblende, and opaque minerals, are, in places, concentrated in layers. Almandine (up to 1 cm in diameter) makes up as much as 3 percent of the mode, while hornblende, commonly 0.5 to 0.75 cm in length, constitutes less than 1 percent. The rock breaks along cleavage surfaces that are commonly rich in chlorite, giving the whole rock a light green color. A U-Pb zircon age from this rock is 1144 +/- 2 Ma; two different populations of monazite give ages of 1106 +/- 1 Ma and 1063 +/- 1 Ma, respectively (Aleinikoff and others, 1993). This unit is the oldest dated granitic rock in the northern Virginia Blue Ridge, and is very commonly intruded by dikes of the Marshall Metagranite (Ym) and garnetiferous leucocratic metagranite (Ygt), and less commonly by leucocratic metagranite (Yg).

In the Lynchburg area the Moneta was mapped as Reusens Migmatite by Brown (1958). It was interpreted to be a Late Precambrian volcanic-sedimentary complex by Conley and Henika (1970) and Wang and Glover (1991). The Moneta is here assigned to the Lynchburg Group because it has an intertonguing re la tion ship with basal conglomeratic Lynchburg rocks and with similar rocks in the base of the Ashe Formation southwest of Lynchburg.

From expanded explanation (rewf. VA002): Diana Mills complex (Brown, 1969). Principally hornblende metadiorite and hornblende-quartz metadiorite; includes hornblendite, amphibolite, metaperidotite, orbicular serpentinite, pegmatite, and aplite. Metamorphosed hornblende diorite and hornblende-quartz diorite are dark-grayish-green, medium-grained porphyritic, and massive to crudely-foliated. Phenocrysts are 1 to 10 mm anhedral to subhedral plagioclase of intermediate composition; matrix minerals include hornblende and plagioclase, with variable amounts of biotite and quartz. Accessory minerals include: apatite, zircon, muscovite, magnetite, ilmenite, and pyrrhotite. Epidote, chlorite, and titanite are common secondary minerals. Hornblendites are dark-green, medium- to coarse-grained rocks consisting dominantly of blocky euhedral to subhedral hornblende, with minor interstitial highly altered feldspar, and apatite. Amphibolite and metaperidotite are dark-green coarse grained rocks composed of anhedral pale-green uralitic hornblende which in places contains relict clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene, and rounded blebs of serpentine with cores of acicular tremolite, apparently after olivine. Orbicular serpentinite is dark-gray serpentinite composed of variable amounts of talc, amphibole, and chlorite, with fragmentary remnant pyroxene; the rock contains rouned orbicules from about 2 to 20 cm in diameter. These are composed predominantly of fibrous antigorite, oriented in concentric bands around the periphery, and contain cracks filled with magnetite, chlorite, and talc. Pegmatite and aplite are composed of plagioclase, epidote, clinozoisite, muscovite, and quartz; hornblende megacrysts are present in some pegmatite. The complex is generally concordant with the foliation in the enclosing metagraywacke (Czpm), which shows enlarged micas and mica porphryoblasts adjacent to the contact. Structural setting and rock assemblage are suggestive of a layered intrusive sill (Brown, 1969). More recently the Diana Mills has been interpreted as an exotic block, emplaced within the enclosing unit by gravity sliding, or by other tectonic means (Brown and Pavlides, 1981; W. R.

He notes that the pluton contains metasedimentary xenoliths that resemble the enclosing metagraywacke, and has a thermal aureole that is manifested by garnet and biotite porphryoblasts in the surrounding country rocks.

From expanded explanation (ref. VA002): Swift Run Formation (Jonas and Stose, 1939; King, 1950; Gathright, 1976). Heterogeneous assemblage includes: pebbly to cobbly quartzite and feldspathic metaconglomerate; gray, grayish-pink, or grayish-green, feldspathic quartzite and metasandstone, locally crossbedded; greenish-gray, silvery quartz-sericite-chlorite sandy schist; and, greenish-gray to grayish-red-purple chlorite-sericite tuffaceous phyllite and slate. In Loudoun County, contains pinkish-gray and yellowish-gray to light brownish-gray, fine-grained dolomitic marble (Southworth, 1991). Individual lithologies are laterally discontinuous; formation ranges up to 350 feet in total thickness, but is locally very thin or absent (Gathright, 1976). The Swift Run was originally defined on the northwest limb of the Blue Ridge anticlinorium (Stose and Stose, 1946), where the unit rests unconformably on Grenville-age rocks, and is overlain conformably by the Catoctin Formation; the upper contact is mapped at the bottom of the lowest massive metabasalt. In places Swift Run lithologies are interbedded with Catoctin metabasalts, and the contact between the two units is gradational (Gathright, 1976). Swift Run metasedimentary rocks on the northwest limb have been interpreted as deposited in alluvial fan, floodplain, and lacustrine environments (Schwab, 1986); these are interbedded with metamorphosed tuffaceous and volcanoclastic units (Gathright, 1976; Bartholomew, 1977). Although the Swift Run has been interpreted as a thin western equivalent of the Lynchburg Group in the southeastern Blue Ridge (Stose and Stose, 1946; Brown, 1970), some workers have correlated the Swift Run with discontinuous lenses of feldspathic sandstone interbedded with felsic metatuff that occur immediately below the Catoctin on the southeast limb of the anticlinorium (Nelson, 1962; Conley, 1978; 1989; Wehr, 1985). On the Geologic Map of Virginia (1993), the Swift Run is terminated along an east-west-trending normal fault just west of Leesburg, and is not mapped farther southwest on the southeast limb of the Blue Ridge anticlinorium.

Grayish-green, fine- to coarse-grained basaltic tuff, metavolcanic breccia, and porphyritic to amygdaloidal greenstone, with minor interlayered metasedimentary rocks. Hydrothermally mineralized zones occur within the greenstones; these contain bornite, chalcocite, and chalcopyrite, and have been mined for copper. Mineralogy: plagioclase + hornblende + chlorite + epidote + calcite + apatite + quartz + opaque minerals. Geophysical signature: linear positive magnetic anomaly. Watson (1911) used the term Virgilina Group for a wide belt of rocks in the vicinity of Virgilina, Virginia. Mafic metavolcanic rocks in this sequence were named Virgilina greenstone, and felsic metavolcanic rocks and associated metasedimentary rocks were named Aaron slate by Laney (1917). Kreisa (1980) refined Laney's stratigraphy in defining the Aaron Formation as containing upper and lower members equivalent to Laney's Aaron slate, and a middle member equivalent to the Virgilina greenstone. The stratigraphy was further modified by Harris and Glover (1985), who combined the middle and upper members of Kreisa's Aaron Formation to make the Virgilina Formation. Virgilina greenstone is herein used in the sense of Laney (1917), but is equivalent to the middle member of the Aaron Formation of Kreisa (1980), and the lower portion of the Virgilina Formation of Harris and Glover (1985) (Figure 2).
