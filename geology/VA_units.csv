Units here mapped as Alligator Back Formation were previously mapped as the Evington Group (Espenshade, 1954; Brown, 1958; Redden, 1963; Gates, 1986; Patterson, 1987) and considered to be younger than the Lynchburg Group. Regional mapping by Henika (1991) and Scheible (1975) indicates that rocks assigned to Alligator Back Formation by Rankin and others (1973) are continuous with the upper part of the Lynchburg Group in the type section along the James River at Lynchburg (Jonas, 1927) and that the Alligator Back consistently dips southeast beneath the overlying Candler Formation from the Virginia-North Carolina border to the James River at Lynchburg. Sedimentary and structural facing criteria indicate that rock units immediately southeast of the Candler Formation in an outcrop belt from Stapleton on the James River, southwest to Leesville Dam on the Roanoke River, are older than the Candler (Henika, 1992). Although previously mapped as upper Evington Group (Espenshade, 1954; Brown, 1958; Redden, 1963; Patterson, 1987), these rocks are herein correlated with the Alligator Back Formation (upper Lynchburg Group), having been uplifted against the Candler Formation to the northwest along the Bowens Creek fault (Henika, 1992). Rocks in the same outcrop belt along strike to the southwest of the Leesville Reservoir were previously correlated with the Alligator Back Formation by Conley (1985). The sequence of lithologic units within the Alligator Back Formation southeast of the Bowens Creek fault is the same as that proposed by Brown (1951; 1958), and Espenshade (1954) for the formations in the Evington Group, that are structurally above the Candler Formation. The sequence is based on the detailed structural and stratigraphic relationships first established by Brown (1958) in the Lynchburg 15-minute quadrangle.

It is unconformably overlain by Middle Ordovician limestones and conformably overlies the Stonehenge Limestone. Erosion, related to the unconformity at the top of the Beekmantown Group and Knox Group, has produced erosional breccias, local topographic relief, and paleokarst topography as well as significant regional thinning of the rock units.

The Everona occurs dominantly as lenticular bodies immediately north west of or within the Mountain Run fault zone (Evans, 1984; Conley, 1989; Rossman, 1991). In most outcrops primary laminations are complexly folded due to strain accommodation associated with the Mountain Run fault. Unit thickness and degree of lateral continuity are structurally controlled in many places. Mack (1965) reports thicknesses ranging from about 20 to 1100 feet. Jonas (1927) reports retrieving trilobite fragments from sandy beds adjacent to the Everona, but these were so poorly preserved that E.O. Ulrich could not identify them, even with respect to genus. Recent attempts to extract conodonts from the Everona have so far proven fruitless.

Light- to medium-gray, fine- to medium grained, polydeformed and polymetamorphosed porphyroblastic aluminosilicate-mica schist, interlayered with medium-gray irregularly-layered garnetiferous biotite gneiss, migmatitic in part; calcsilicate granofels; amphibolite; rare white marble; and, coarse calc-quartzite lenses. Complex schistosity, multiple crenulation cleavages, and partly-retrograded, polymetamorphic aluminosilicate and garnet porphyroblasts are diagnostic of Fork Mountain schists. Primary sedimentary structures rarely are preserved. A spectacular polymictic breccia bed that can be traced along strike for several miles within the Fork Mountain near Stuart is a notable exception. Medium- to coarse-granular, blue quartz lenses, angular to rounded inclusions of boudinaged fine-grained, color-laminated, calc-silicate rock, and thick beds of coarse, clast-supported, epidotized lithic breccia are typical of the Fork Mountain biotite gneiss.

Contact metamorphic mineral assemblages: (1) andalusite + sillimanite + kyanite + corundum; (2) corundum + spinel + magnetite + kyanite. Geophysical signature: The Fork Mountain has a characteristic ""curly maple"" pattern on magnetic contour maps. This pattern is the result of isolated concentrations of highly magnetic minerals that produce rounded, high-intensity, positive and negative anomalies. The aluminosilicate-mica schist is the upper part of the Fork Mountain Formation and forms a series of northeastward- trending ridges along the northwest side of the Smith River allochthon. The garnetiferous biotite gneiss is at a lower structural level of the Fork Mountain Formation near Martinsville where lower strata have been intruded by the Martinsville igneous complex, and the remaining metasedimentary rocks contain extensive thermal meta mor phic zones locallized along the intrusive contacts (Conley and Henika, 1973). Biotite gneiss in the Fork Mountain Formation has been interpreted to be a highly metamorphosed diamictite (Rankin, 1975; Conley, 1985; and Pavlides, 1989). At the northeastern limit of the Fork Mountain outcrop belt, in Appomattox and Buckingham counties, the dominant lithologies are polydeformed yellowish-gray chloritoid-chlorite- muscovite quartzose phyllite and quartz-rich mica schist. Tightly-folded, transposed pinstriped segregation layering at a high angle to the penetrative schistosity defined by phyllosilicate minerals is characteristic; polycrystalline quartz-rich boudins are abundant. These rocks are lithologically indistinguishable from those along the highly-tectonized western margin of the metagraywacke, quartzose schist, and melange (CZpm) outcrop belt; current interpretation is that the Fork Mountain is correlative to some degree with CZpm.

From Scott and Washington counties to Highland County and northwest of the Pulaski and North Mountain faults, a multitude of stratigraphic names have been applied to the rocks between the Bays or Moccasin (above) and the Beekmantown or Knox (below). The lack of detailed geologic mapping, except in Scott and Giles counties, the restricted area of the two major stratigraphic studies (Cooper and Prouty, 1943; Kay, 1956), and the general disagreement as to mappability and correlation of units makes it impossible to apply specific stratigraphic nomenclature at this time.

From expanded explanation (ref. VA002): Metabasalt breccia (low-titanium) (Espenshade, 1986). Blocky or angular fragments of grayish-green, fine grained rock in a fine-grained, ge erally schistose matrix. Breccia fragments range from 1 to 20 cm long, and form rough, knobby surfaces on weathered outcrops. Where present, this breccia occurs at or near the base of Catoctin metabasalt (CZc) on the southeast limb of the Blue Ridge anticlinorium; the unit is as much as 3000 feet thick. Furcron (1939) mapped both high- and low-titanium breccias as Warrenton agglomerate; R.L. Smith (personal communication in Espenshade, 1986) interpreted the breccias as subareal agglutinates. Kline and others (1990) presented evidence that the breccias are hyaloclastite pillow breccias, erupted in a subaqueous environment. Reed (1955) recognized a mappable stratigraphy within the Catoctin, and made the interpretation that the greenstones were metamorphosed tholeiitic flood basalts that originated in a ""nonorogenic"" setting. Rankin (1975) considered the Catoctin to have originated during continental volcanism associated with the opening of a proto-Atlantic Iapetus ocean in Latest Precambrian time, and included the Catoctin in the Crossnore volcanic-plutonic group. Badger and Sinha (1988) studied chemical stratigraphy within individual fl ows and dated Catoctin metabasalts at 570 +/- 36 Ma using Rb-Sr systematics on samples showing little evidence of elemental mobility during metamorphism. This date is consistent with radiometric age data from Catoctin metarhyolite, discussed above, and with the occurrence of Early Cambrian-age Rusophycus stratigraphically above the Catoctin near the base of the Chilhowee Group (Simpson and Sundberg, 1987). These constraints suggest that some portion of the Catoctin may be as young as Cambrian in age. Regional mapping suggests that metabasalts and amphibole gneisses within the Ashe (Zaa), Alligator Back (CZas), and Bassett Formations (CZba) are volcanogenic rocks that are correlative with the Catoctin in a lithostratigraphic sense and in terms of tectonic setting, but not necessarily in a strict time sense.

From expanded explanation (ref. VA002): Metagraywacke, quartzose schist, and melange. Metagraywackes are quartzose chlorite or biotite schists containing very fine to coarse granules of blue quartz; primary graded laminations have been transposed by shearing into elongate lozenges that give the rock a distinctive pin-striped appearance in weathered surfaces perpendicular to schistosity. A mylonitic fabric is superimposed in varying degrees, as are late-stage chevron-style folds. In Buckingham, Appomattox, and Campbell Counties, rocks in this unit are progressively more tectonized from east to west across the outcrop belt; in the western portion, the dominant lithology is a polydeformed, mylonitic mica schist with abundant quartz-rich boudins; transposed pinstriped lamination or segregation layering at a high angle to mylonitic schistosity is characteristic. Metagabbroic blocks ranging in size from 5 cm to 3 m across and larger have been identified at widely scattered locations throughout the outcrop belt. Mineralogy: quartz + albite + epidote + chlorite + muscovite + magnetite +/- chloritoid +/- calcite; biotite- and staurolite-bearing assemblages occur in Appomattox and Campbell Counties. Detrital minerals identifi ed in thin section include plagioclase, perthite, epidote, magnetite, tourmaline, and titanite. Lithic fragments include dacite tuff, gabbro, and monocrystalline quartz with zircon and biotite inclusions (Evans, 1984). The northern portion of the outcrop belt includes melange zone IV of the Mine Run complex of Pavlides (1989; 1990).

Breccia (or ""diatreme"") contain abundant xenoliths of older igneous rock, sedimentary county rock, and xenocrysts of various minerals. Radiometric dates for some of the intrusive rocks are Eocene in age (Fuller and Bottino, 1969). Field relationships of other bodies suggest Mesozoic emplacement. Alkalic intrusive rocks, including nepheline-syenite, teschenite-syenite, and teschenite-picrite occur in Augusta County (Rader, 1967).

Lithology highly variable, depending on the nature of the parent rock, and on intensive parameters and history of deformation. In most mapped belts of mylonite and cataclastic rock (my), tectonized rocks anastomose around lenses of less-deformed or undeformed rock. In the Blue Ridge, some of these lenses are large enough to show at 1:500,000 scale. In many places mylonitic and cataclastic rocks are gradational into less deformed or undeformed adjacent rocks, and location of contacts between tectonized rocks (my) and adjacent units is approximate or arbitrary. These boundaries are indicated on the map by color-color joins with superimposed shear pattern. Most mapped belts of mylonite represent fault zones with multiple movement histories. In the Blue Ridge, Paleozoic age contractional deformation fabrics are superimposed on Late Precambrian extensional fabrics (Simpson and Kalaghan, 1989; Bailey and Simpson, 1993).

From expanded explanation (ref. VA002): Slate and porphyroblastic schist. Dominantly dark gray to grayish-black, lustrous, very-fine-grained, graphitic slate (northeastern sector); and, medium-grained, porphyroblastic garnetiferous biotite schist (southwestern sector). Discontinuous beds of quartzose muscovite schist, coarse grained to pebbly micaceous quartzite, and conglomeratic schist occur along the margins of the outcrop belt, stratigraphically at the base of the section. Interbeds of dacite metatuff occur in the western portion of the slate outcrop belt. Graded laminated metasiltstone and metasandstone are interbedded with slate in the central and eastern portions of the outcrop belt at the latitude of the James River (Evans and Marr, 1988); these rocks pass into porphyroblastic schists at higher metamorphic grades to the southwest. A distinctive garnet-amphibole-quartz interbed occurs within porphyroblastic schist south of the James River (volcanogenic marker?; Brown, 1969); north of the river, this passes down metamoprphic grade into what is described as an oolitic chlorite schist (Smith and others, 1964). Mineralogy: (slate) chlorite + mus co vite + plagioclase + quartz + magnetite +/- biotite +/- calcite +/- graphite +/- pyrite; (porphyroblastic schist) biotite + muscovite + garnet + quartz + plagioclase + magnetite +/- kyanite +/- calcite; tourmaline and zircon are common accessories. Geophysical signature: The Arvonia is marked by positive magnetic and radiometric anomalies. Originally referred to as the slate in the Arvonia belt by Rogers (1884), the unit was named Arvonia slate by Stose and Stose (1948), and raised to formation status by Brown (1969). An Upper Ordovician age for the Arvonia has been established from fossils collected by Watson and Powell (1911), Stose and Stose (1948), Tillman (1970), and Kolata and Pavlides (1986). The Arvonia has long been considered unconformable on top of adjacent units. Micaceous quartzite, pebbly mus covite schist, and conglomeratic schist are common at the base of the section where that boundary is not faulted (Stose and Stose, 1948; Smith and others, 1964; Brown, 1969; Evans and Marr, 1988). The base of the Arvonia is exposed in an old railroad cut near Carysbrook, Fluvanna County (Smith and others, 1964); there, a micaceous quartzite containing quartz pebbles rests on granite of the Carysbrook pluton. The Stoses (1948) considered the Arvonia a sequence deposited on a post-Taconic-orogeny regional unconformity, and folded and metamorphosed during subsequent orogenies; that interpretation is consistent with geologic constraints as we know them today. The Arvonia is correlated with the Quantico Formation. History of the Arvonia district slate industry is discussed by Brown (1969) and Evans and Marr (1988). ",VA003,slate,schist,,VA001 VA002 VA003,

Includes greenish-gray conglomeratic quartzose muscovite schist containing ellipsoidal clasts of milky quartz, dusky-red quartzite, dark gray aphanitic rock, and greenish-gray phyllite; greenish-gray chlorite-muscovite schist with medium to fine, grayish-blue quartz grains; grayish-green chlorite-muscovite phyllite; biotite-muscovite-quartz schist. Mineral assemblages are those found in Arvonia slates and porphyroblastic schists. Conglomeratic schist occurs along the western margin of the principal Buffards outcrop belt, and as discontinuous lenses too small to show at 1:500,000 scale, at or near the western margin (stratigraphic base) of the Arvonia slate outcrop belt (Oa) (Evans and Marr, 1988). Although Brown (1969) in defining the Buffards Formation considered these rocks to be a pyroclastic deposit stratigraphically above the Arvonia Formation, other workers have interpreted Buffards rocks to be at a lower stratigraphic position relative to the Arvonia. Conley and Marr (1980) considered the Buffards part of the Chopawamsic Formation, unconformably below the Arvonia. Stose and Stose (1948) and Evans and Marr (1988) considered the Buffards to be stratigraphically at or near the base of the Arvonia Formation. Buffards conglomeratic schists contain tuffaceous and ferruginous-quartzite clasts similar to rocks that occur in the Chopawamsic Formation; this is consistent with the Buffards being derived in part from, and deposited unconformably on, the Chopawamsic.

These quartzarenites consist of five tongues in northern Buchanan County (Lovett and others, 1992); but to the east only the lowest tongue exists (Whitlock, 1989; Nolde, 1989), and that grades eastward into sandstone in the New River Formation in eastern Buchanan, northeastern Russell, and western Tazewell counties. Formerly rocks east of the quartzarenites were con sid ered Lee (Harnsberger, 1919; Virginia Division of Mineral Resources, 1963), but now are designated New River Formation (Englund, 1981) and correlative to the lower part of the Norton Formation. The Lee Formation thickens and truncates progressively older rocks northwestward (Miller, 1974). The intertonguing and unconformable relationship accounts for the great range in thickness for the Lee Formation. It ranges in thickness from 0 in southern Buchanan County (Meissner and Miller, 1981), to 1680 feet in Lee County (Miller and Roen, 1973).

The Division of Mineral Resources uses the name Clinch Formation for exposures in Lee, Wise, and Scott counties where the lower Silurian rocks include the lower Hagan Shale Member and the upper Poor Valley Ridge Sand stone Member. The name Tuscarora Formation is used for the lower Silurianquartzitic sandstone unit in all areas northward in the Valley and Ridge of Virginia, including the Clinch Mountain area where the name Clinch Formation was first used, because of similarity between the Tuscarora and the rocks on Clinch Mountain. In the past many geologists used the name Clinch Sandstone in the southern part of the Valley and Ridge of Virginia and the name Tuscarora Formation in the northern part of the Valley and Ridge of Virginia (Butts, 1940) for essentially the same group of quartzitic sandstones. Dennison and Boucot (1974) and Mill er (1976) described the facies change of the lower Silurian Clinch Sandstone of Southwest Virginia from quartzitic sandstones in the Clinch Mountain belt in Scott and Wise Counties to sandstones and shales in the Lee, southwestern Wise, and western Scott counties area.

Mineralogy: hornblende + clinopyroxene + plagioclase + magnetite + biotite +/- scapolite +/- garnet +/- quartz +/- epidote. Geophysical signature: narrow, strike-elongate, positive magnetic anomaly. Lenses and layers of amphibolite and amphibole gneiss are interlayered with porphyroblastic garnet-biotite gneiss (Ymd). The mafic rocks constitute 50 percent or more of the section in a zone about 0.62 mile wide surrounding outcrop areas of State Farm gneiss (Ysf); farther away from the State Farm contact, lenses and layers of amphibolite and amphibole gneiss are more widely scattered, but are laterally persistent and outline map-scale structures (Marr, 1985). Amphibolite and interlayered biotite gneiss adjacent to the State Farm gneiss were named the Sabot amphibolite by Poland (1976), who characterized the formation as a tabular sheet 0.7 to 1.0 km thick. He and Goodwin (1970) interpreted these amphibolites as metamorphosed mafic volcanic or pyroclastic rocks. Glover and others (1989 and references therein) report a low-angle regional discordance between the base of the Sabot and the compositional layering in the underlying State Farm Gneiss.

Metamorphosed anorthosite includes non-foliated extremely coarse-grained and foliated, recrystallized coarse-grained textural varieties. Primary mineralogy consists of antiperthitic plagioclase, clinopyroxene, apatite, and ilmenite. Amphibole, biotite, quartz, garnet, rutile, and titanite occur as later metamorphic minerals (Farrar, 1984). Xenoliths in the anorthosite could have been derived from the adjacent amphibolite and amphibole gneiss (Ya), porphyroblastic garnet-biotite gneiss (Ymd), and State Farm gneiss (Ysf).	 Geophysical signature: positive radiometric and negative magnetic anomalies. Close geochemical similarities between the Montpelier and the Grenville-age Roseland anorthosite of the central Blue Ridge (Yra) have led to the hypothesis, as yet untested, that the Montpelier is Grenville in age (Clement and Bice, 1982; Farrar, 1984).

Mesocratic, medium- to coarse-grained, biotite-rich quartzofeldspathic gneiss con tains prominent subhedral to euhedral monocrystalline feldspar augen. The ratio plagioclase: potassium feldspar may be as high as 10:1; color index ranges from 30 to 50. Apatite, epidote, muscovite, ilmenite, and titanite are ubiquitous accessories. Plagioclase contains abundant prismatic epidote and white mica; ilmenite is rimmed with masses of anhedral titanite; subhedral hornblende and subhedral to euhedral almandine-grossular garnet occur locally. In the vicinity of adjacent charnockite, anhedral actinolitic amphibole pseudomorphs after pyroxene or rims thoroughly uralitized relict pyroxene. Rock fabric is gradational from granofels to mylonite gneiss. Geophysical signature: negative magnetic signature relative to adjacent charnockite. In northern Virginia, this unit strongly resembles prophyroblastic granite gneiss (Ybp); however, the augen in Ybp are more commonly polycrystalline aggregates rather than single-crystal porphyroblasts. This unit is widespread in the central and southeastern Blue Ridge, encompassing a number of lithologically similar metaplutonic entities: the ""biotitic facies""of the Roses Mill and Turkey Mountain ferrodiorites of Herz and Force (1987), the Archer Mountain quartz monzonite of Bartholomew and others (1981), biotite granofels and augen gneiss of Evans (1984, 1991), biotite augen gneiss of Conley (1989), and augen-bearing gneiss of Lukert and Halladay (1980), and Lukert and Nuckols (1976). Historically, most workers have interpreted these rocks as Grenville-age plutons in which the present-day biotite-rich mineral assemblage is a primary igneous assemblage that crystallized from a melt (for example, Bartholomew and others, 1981). Herz and Force (1987) and Evans (1991) presented evidence that these biotite gneisses were derived from charnockite plutons by retrograde hydration reactions.	 Pettingill and others (1984) reported ages of 1009 +/- 26 Ma (Rb-Sr whole-rock) and 1004 +/- 36 Ma (Sm-Nd whole-rock) for ferrodiorite to quartzmonzonite in the Roseland district.

Porphyroblasts of potassium feldspar range from 1 to 10 cm while plagioclase and quartz are generally 2 cm or less in maximum dimension. Mafic minerals, including almandine, biotite, chlorite, hornblende, and opaque minerals, are, in places, concentrated in layers. Almandine (up to 1 cm in diameter) makes up as much as 3 percent of the mode, while hornblende, commonly 0.5 to 0.75 cm in length, constitutes less than 1 percent. The rock breaks along cleavage surfaces that are commonly rich in chlorite, giving the whole rock a light green color. A U-Pb zircon age from this rock is 1144 +/- 2 Ma; two different populations of monazite give ages of 1106 +/- 1 Ma and 1063 +/- 1 Ma, respectively (Aleinikoff and others, 1993). This unit is the oldest dated granitic rock in the northern Virginia Blue Ridge, and is very commonly intruded by dikes of the Marshall Metagranite (Ym) and garnetiferous leucocratic metagranite (Ygt), and less commonly by leucocratic metagranite (Yg).

VA002): Porphyroblastic garnet-biotite gneiss. Heterogeneous layered sequence is dominantly garnetiferous biotite gneiss and porphyroblastic gneiss, migmatitic in part, with subordinate interlayered amphibolite and amphibole gneiss (Ya), pelitic-composition gneiss, calcsilicate gneiss, biotite hornblende-quartz-plagioclase gneiss, and garnetiferous leucogneiss. These lithologies contain amphibolite-facies metamorphic mineral assemblages consistent with rock chemistry. Farrar (1984) reports relict granulite-facies assemblages in some rocks. This unit underlies a wide area that surrounds the State Farm antiform (Poland, 1976; Reilly, 1980; Farrar, 1984) and two subsidiary antiforms to the northeast; the unit includes the Maidens gneiss and portions of the Sabot amphibolite of Poland (1976), the eastern gneiss complex and Boscobel granodiorite gneiss of Bobyarchick (1976), and the Po River Metamorphic Suite of Pavlides (1980). Poland (1976) and Reilly (1980) proposed that the Maidens gneiss and Sabot amphibolite were a Late Precambrian- to Early Paleozoic-age volcanic-sedimentary cover sequence unconformably overlying the State Farm gneiss. Farrar (1984) interpreted relict granulite-facies mineral assemblages to have equilibrated during Grenville-age regional metamorphism; this contributed to his conclusion that the Sabot and Maidens, in addition to the State Farm, are Grenville or pre-Grenville in age. Porphyroblastic garnet-biotite gneiss (Ymd) is intruded by rocks of the Carboniferous-age Falmouth Intrusive Suite (Pavlides, 1980). ",VA003,biotite gneiss,,,VA001 VA002 VA003,

Principally hornblende metadiorite and hornblende-quartz metadiorite; includes hornblendite, amphibolite, metaperidotite, orbicular serpentinite, pegmatite, and aplite. Metamorphosed hornblende diorite and hornblende-quartz diorite are dark-grayish-green, medium-grained porphyritic, and massive to crudely-foliated. Phenocrysts are 1 to 10 mm anhedral to subhedral plagioclase of intermediate composition; matrix minerals include hornblende and plagioclase, with variable amounts of biotite and quartz. Accessory minerals include: apatite, zircon, muscovite, magnetite, ilmenite, and pyrrhotite. Epidote, chlorite, and titanite are common secondary minerals. Hornblendites are dark-green, medium- to coarse-grained rocks consisting dominantly of blocky euhedral to subhedral hornblende, with minor interstitial highly altered feldspar, and apatite. Amphibolite and metaperidotite are dark-green coarse grained rocks composed of anhedral pale-green uralitic hornblende which in places contains relict clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene, and rounded blebs of serpentine with cores of acicular tremolite, apparently after olivine. Orbicular serpentinite is dark-gray serpentinite composed of variable amounts of talc, amphibole, and chlorite, with fragmentary remnant pyroxene; the rock contains rouned orbicules from about 2 to 20 cm in diameter. These are composed predominantly of fibrous antigorite, oriented in concentric bands around the periphery, and contain cracks filled with magnetite, chlorite, and talc. Pegmatite and aplite are composed of plagioclase, epidote, clinozoisite, muscovite, and quartz; hornblende megacrysts are present in some pegmatite. The complex is generally concordant with the foliation in the enclosing metagraywacke (Czpm), which shows enlarged micas and mica porphryoblasts adjacent to the contact. Structural setting and rock assemblage are suggestive of a layered intrusive sill (Brown, 1969).

From expanded explanation (ref. VA002): Swift Run Formation (Jonas and Stose, 1939; King, 1950; Gathright, 1976). Heterogeneous assemblage includes: pebbly to cobbly quartzite and feldspathic metaconglomerate; gray, grayish-pink, or grayish-green, feldspathic quartzite and metasandstone, locally crossbedded; greenish-gray, silvery quartz-sericite-chlorite sandy schist; and, greenish-gray to grayish-red-purple chlorite-sericite tuffaceous phyllite and slate. In Loudoun County, contains pinkish-gray and yellowish-gray to light brownish-gray, fine-grained dolomitic marble (Southworth, 1991). Individual lithologies are laterally discontinuous; formation ranges up to 350 feet in total thickness, but is locally very thin or absent (Gathright, 1976). The Swift Run was originally defined on the northwest limb of the Blue Ridge anticlinorium (Stose and Stose, 1946), where the unit rests unconformably on Grenville-age rocks, and is overlain conformably by the Catoctin Formation; the upper contact is mapped at the bottom of the lowest massive metabasalt. In places Swift Run lithologies are interbedded with Catoctin metabasalts, and the contact between the two units is gradational (Gathright, 1976). Swift Run metasedimentary rocks on the northwest limb have been interpreted as deposited in alluvial fan, floodplain, and lacustrine environments (Schwab, 1986); these are interbedded with metamorphosed tuffaceous and volcanoclastic units (Gathright, 1976; Bartholomew, 1977). Although the Swift Run has been interpreted as a thin western equivalent of the Lynchburg Group in the southeastern Blue Ridge (Stose and Stose, 1946; Brown, 1970), some workers have correlated the Swift Run with discontinuous lenses of feldspathic sandstone interbedded with felsic metatuff that occur immediately below the Catoctin on the southeast limb of the anticlinorium (Nelson, 1962; Conley, 1978; 1989; Wehr, 1985). On the Geologic Map of Virginia (1993), the Swift Run is terminated along an east-west-trending normal fault just west of Leesburg, and is not mapped farther southwest on the southeast limb of the Blue Ridge anticlinorium.

VA002): Virgilina greenstone (Laney, 1917). Grayish-green, fine- to coarse-grained basaltic tuff, metavolcanic breccia, and porphyritic to amygdaloidal greenstone, with minor interlayered metasedimentary rocks. Hydrothermally mineralized zones occur within the greenstones; these contain bornite, chalcocite, and chalcopyrite, and have been mined for copper. Mineralogy: plagioclase + hornblende + chlorite + epidote + calcite + apatite + quartz + opaque minerals. Geophysical signature: linear positive magnetic anomaly. Watson (1911) used the term Virgilina Group for a wide belt of rocks in the vicinity of Virgilina, Virginia. Mafic metavolcanic rocks in this sequence were named Virgilina greenstone, and felsic metavolcanic rocks and associated metasedimentary rocks were named Aaron slate by Laney (1917). Kreisa (1980) refined Laney's stratigraphy in defining the Aaron Formation as containing upper and lower members equivalent to Laney's Aaron slate, and a middle member equivalent to the Virgilina greenstone. The stratigraphy was further modified by Harris and Glover (1985), who combined the middle and upper members of Kreisa's Aaron Formation to make the Virgilina Formation. Virgilina greenstone is herein used in the sense of Laney (1917), but is equivalent to the middle member of the Aaron Formation of Kreisa (1980), and the lower portion of the Virgilina Formation of Harris and Glover (1985) (Figure 2).
