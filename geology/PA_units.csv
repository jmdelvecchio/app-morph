PA003): All three members of the Kinzers--the Emigsville, the York, and the Greenmount--are assigned to off-shelf environments. The basal Emigsville is a laterally persistent basinal facies with two components. The lower third is argillaceous dolomite and dolomitic limestone, overlain by shale. The York includes well-bedded lime mudstones, oolitic and bioclastic lime grainstones, and minor occurrences of periplatform breccia. [York was called Thomasville Member by Gohn (1976).] The Greenmount Member is a distinctive, impure carbonate (dark, pyritic, laminated to nodular limestone) with abundant fine-grained siliciclastic sediment which occurs as black shaly interbeds and dispersed silt-sized quartz and feldspar grains. Age of the Kinzers is Early Cambrian. Kinzers Formation in the West York block of the Conestoga Valley, York Co., PA, is here subdivided into the basal Emigsville Member (Gohn, 1976), the York Member (new name), and the Greenmount Member (new name). Emigsville is the most laterally persistent. Thickness in the report area is approximately 100 to 200 ft. York Member is well exposed in Pit 1 at the Delta Carbonate Quarry. York previously informally designated Thomasville member by Gohn (1976). Thickness approximately 1000 to 1200 ft. Consists very pure to moderately pure carbonates. Greenmount Member described as sandstone and siltstone with very little carbonate where weathered. May be equivalent to Gohn's (1976) Longs Park member in Lancaster Co. Thickness varies from 50 ft to 180 ft. Authors state, ""The long history of use of the name Kinzers dictates the need for its continued use. The rocks included within the Kinzers Formation, however, vary dramatically from the type locality in Lancaster Co. to the York Valley portion of the Conestoga Valley. The unit thickens from about 200 ft to 1450 ft. . . . There may be some logic, therefore, in assigning group status to the name."" Underlies Ledger Formation.

Unit is a succession of dolomites overlying the Rockdale Run formation and underlying the Row Park limestone. Formation averages about 450 feet thick and the top of the Pinesburg Station is placed at the base of the lowest limestone bed in the overlying Row Park. The lack of fossils in this unit makes it difficult to date, however, correlation to sections in PA suggest that the Lower-Middle Ordovician boundary is near the top of the Pinesburg Station dolomite and is therefore tentatively placed at the top of the formation.

Consists of interbedded limestones and dolomites overlying the Stonehenge limestone. The lower two-thirds of the formation is predominantly limestone, while dolomite dominates the upper third. The top of the Rockdale Run is placed at the top of the highest limestone bed beneath the Pinesburg Station dolomite. The formation averages about 2450 feet thick.
